## Transaction Reconciliation (Example)

Goal: demonstrate a structured approach to reconciling expected vs received amounts.

What this covers:
- Expected vs actual amount checks
- Fee impact (network/exchange)
- Rounding/decimals issues
- Basic anomaly flags

Files:
- `sample_transactions.csv` - small simulated dataset
- `analysis.py` - simple reconciliation logic in Python
