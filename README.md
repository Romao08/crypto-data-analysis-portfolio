# Crypto & Fintech Data Analysis Portfolio

Small, self-contained projects showcasing my approach to data analysis in crypto and financial systems, with an emphasis on correctness, transparency, and decision support.


Focus areas:
- KPI definition and interpretation
- Transaction-level analysis and reconciliation logic
- Data quality checks and anomaly detection
- Clear communication of findings

Notes:
- Projects use simplified or simulated datasets
- No proprietary or confidential company data is included
